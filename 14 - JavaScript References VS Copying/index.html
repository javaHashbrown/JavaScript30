    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way
    team2[3] = 'Lux';

    console.log(team, team2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    //console.table(person);
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    //console.table(person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{number: 99});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person, occupation: 'programmer',age: 35};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
